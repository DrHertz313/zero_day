##WHATSAPPBOT

WhatsApp is a cross-platform centralized instant messaging and voice-over-IP service owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. It allows users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content. The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to sign up.

WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop web app.
